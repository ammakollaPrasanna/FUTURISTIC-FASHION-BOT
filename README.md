## ⚙️ How the Models Work

### Color Season Analysis Pipeline

A two-stage CV + DL pipeline runs on every uploaded photo:

1. **Skin Segmentation** — OpenCV isolates skin pixels using a combined YCrCb `(0,133,77)→(255,173,127)` and HSV `(0,10,60)→(20,150,255)` mask, morphologically cleaned with an ellipse kernel
2. **Skin Statistics** — Mean RGB extracted; luminance `Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B`; warm/cool flag computed from R–B delta
3. **Dominant Colors** — K-Means (k=5) on a 150×150 resized image returns the top palette as hex strings
4. **Season Prediction** — MobileNetV2 → GlobalAveragePooling → Dense(256) → Dropout(0.3) → Softmax(4) classifies into Spring / Summer / Autumn / Winter
5. **Confidence Blending** — If DL confidence ≥ 50%, DL wins. Otherwise: `final_conf = dl × 0.4 + heuristic × 0.6`

### Body Type Classification

Canny edge detection divides the full-body image into shoulder / waist / hip zones. Width ratios are compared against IJCST-derived thresholds to classify into one of 7 shapes. Also accepts manual measurements via the calculator.

### Outfit Rating Engine

EfficientNetB0 predicts a 0–1 aesthetic score and simultaneously classifies into 8 style categories. Falls back to a curated 9-occasion scoring table when TensorFlow is unavailable.

### Algorithm Selection (Ensemble)

The system combines:

- **MobileNetV2** — Color season classification (primary)
- **EfficientNetB0** — Outfit aesthetic rating (primary)
- **OpenCV Heuristics** — Skin tone + edge-based body analysis (fallback layer 1)
- **PIL + Rule-based Logic** — Final fallback when CV libraries are absent (fallback layer 2)

### Hyperparameter Optimization

- Transfer learning with frozen MobileNetV2 / EfficientNetB0 base weights
- Fine-tuned Dense head with Dropout regularization
- Models are saved to `.keras` on first run and reloaded on subsequent starts
